  "message": "Hey so I grew up in Japan from 2008-2014 and in middle school a lot of my classmates would go to karaoke to sing Senbonzakura and other vocaloid songs that we’re popular during 2011-2014. When I asked them what the song meant they didn’t really know and said it just sounded cool. The lyrics are mostly consisted of old fashioned Japanese words that no one really uses anymore.",
